## Introduction

**cfn-ovpn-cli** is a shell script that creates a cloud-based Virtual Private Network (VPN) application together with a isolated Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certification Authority, that provides for a secure mobile Wi-Fi roaming solution. The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is used to provision and configure various AWS Resources through an assortment of API calls and AWS Cloudformation templates.

- Talk a little about bash script here.
- Mention that we are making two Amazon Machine Images?

The final product is two generic Amazon Machine Images (AMI), a private one for the PKI and a public one for the VPN application.

## Cloudformation

AWS Cloudformation is a service that provisions and configures cloud resources that are declared in a template file. The template defines a collection of elements as a single unit called a Stack, simplifying the management of cloud infrastructure.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** templates compose a monolithic hierarchical tree structure of nested stacks and orchestration is achieved in a three-phase stack creation/update process that is promoted via a counter variable. The flowchart below illustrates the build process and resouce dependencies:

## OpenVPN

OpenVPN is a popular VPN daemon that is remarkably flexible and relatively simple to setup. It is particularly suitable for small deployments and uses the TLS protocol to secure its tunnels. It derives its cryptographic capabilities from the OpenSSL library.

OpenVPN operates at the backend of a virtual network adapter that acts as an interface between user-space and kernel-space and can function as either a point-to-point adapter (tun-style) for IP-only traffic, or as a fully virtualized Ethernet adapter (tap-style) for all types of traffic. **cfn-ovpn-cli** is configured in tun-style (tun0) mode conceptually as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/openvpn-virtual-adapter.png">
</p>


processing incoming and outgoing network traffic.


and listens for client connections on both the UDP and TCP protocols. 

OpenVPN defines the concept of a control channel and a data channel, both of which are encrypted and secured differently but pass over the same protocol connection. The control channel is encrypted and secured using TLS while the data channel is encrypted using a (stipulated) negotiated block cipher.

As an aside note, OpenVPN can also be compiled with [Mbed TLS](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/) as its cryptographic backend for small code footprint requirements, i.e. embedded systems. This is supposed to ensure the independence of the underlying encryption libraries.

Give an overview here of the handshake and tunnel protocols.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** is setup in the following fashion:

**cfn-ovpn-cli** uses the following parameters:

|   | Control Channel | Data Channel
| :----: |:---: | :---: 
| Encryption | secp521r1 | AES-256-GCM
| Authentication | sha512 | sha512

the client presents a list of supported cipher suites (ciphers and hash functions).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security

cipher AES-256-GCM
auth SHA512
tls-version-min 1.2
tls-crypt hmac-sig.key
tls-cipher TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384

ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (TLS_ECDHE)
Only TLS_DHE and TLS_ECDHE provide forward secrecy. 

key size = robustness of the security
encryption strength is directly related to the key size

## Public Key Infrastructure

A secure VPN requires authentication and this here involves two components:

1. Client/Server Authentication. This ensures that the server and clients are indeed communicating with authorized known entities and not some spoofed fake user/host.

2. A method of hashing each data packet within the system is also established. By authenticating each data packet, the system avoids wasting cpu cycles on decrypting packets that don't meet the authentication rules. Thus preventing many types of attack vectors.

A system that uses key-based authentication requires a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Simply put, a PKI consists of the following:

* A public master Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and a private key.
* A separate public certificate and private key pair for the server.
* A separate public certificate and private key pair for each client.

Conveniently, a awesome utility exist just for the purposes of making PKI management really easy, i.e. [Easy-RSA](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa). Easy-RSA is a framework for managing X.509 PKI. It is based around the concept of a trusted root signing authority and the backend is comprised of the OpenSSL cryptographic library.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** builds two interrelated PKIs on hardened virtual linux servers within a VPC in the AWS Cloud. A trusted root CA is created within the isolated private subnet, only accessible via a Bastion Host and used exclusively to sign certificate requests. A second PKI is created on the OpenVPN application server itself which resides within the public subnet of the VPC. Here the server as well as the client certificates and private keys are generated. Requests and signed certificates are intelligently exchanged between these two systems by way of Cloudformation Stack Updates. This is described in more detail in the Cloudformation section below but suffice to say, hinges around the calling of the ec2 create-image API. The CA is further constrained by a passphrase that is securely stored and retrived via the AWS System Manager Parameter Store secrets management protocol. The elliptical curve secp521r1 key exchange cipher was chosen for smaller key size equivalence and faster execution performance.

## Network Security

Defense in depth is adopted to provide redundancy.

### AWS Network ACLs

Amazon VPC offers a network access control list (NACL) element that provides for an optional layer of security in the form of a stateless firewall, acting at the subnet layer. 

**cfn-ovpn-cli** assembles an ordered set of rules for its public as well as its private subnets. These two NACLs grant only the necessary inbound source or outbound destination routes for their respective privileged or unprivileged ports. All other traffic is denied from even entering the virtual network itself. 

### AWS Security Groups

While NACLs operate at the network subnet level, security groups act at the instance level. An instane is a unit of compute capacity, eg. virtual machine, container or database etc. Conceptually, a secutity group can be thought of as a virtual statefull firewall, surrounding some computational unit, i.e. instance. 

A collection of unordered rules decide whether to allow traffic to reach the computation unit or not. An interesting feature of security groups is that they can reference other security groups as their end-point, exhibiting object like characteristics that simplifying rule creation and management.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** constructs two security groups, a Public Security Group for instances residing on public subnets and similarly, a Private Security Group for instances residing on private subnets. Restrictive rules are applied to ensure only expected traffic is allowed to pass through to the operating system.

### The Linux Kernel Packet Filter

iptables is a user-space utility program that can configure the Linux kernel packet filtering framework as well as NAT and other packet mangling tasks. Various modules can be side-loaded to extend its complex filtering capabilities. 

During Stage-2 of the Cloudformation Stack build process, **cfn-ovpn-cli** installs and configures iptables in a statefull posture within the Public and Private Virtual Linux Servers. Strict rules delineate distinct traffic domains for localhost services, the AWS instance metadata service (IMDS) and forwarded NAT VPN client traffic. As a precautionary measure VPN clients are denied routes to the local LAN.

* input pings are open to the world but rate limited
* input ssh is also rate limited
* ntp only allow to IMDS

### Intrusion Prevention

fail2ban is an intrusion prevention system that safeguards against network brute-force attacks. It operates in conjunction with 
the Linux kernel packet filter, i.e. iptables and monitors log files for selected entries to block offending hosts. **cfn-ovpn-cli** configures a standard filter for sshd on port 22 in aggressive mode.

To Do : OpenVPN filter.

### sshd Hardening

**cfn-ovpn-cli** not only utilizes an external-facing public EC2 instance as a VPN server but also as a Bastion Host, specifically providing access to the PKI residing within its private network. Because of its exposure to potential attacks, the onus is to minimize any chance of penetration, increase the defense of the system and reduce any potential risks from zero day exploits.

Pertaining to the the golden image _Amazon Linux 2_, only non-default settings are discussed here.

- The following straightforward changes are made to the default configuration:

| keyword-argument | Description |
| :---- | :--- |
| `X11Forwarding no` | X11 forwarding is an insecure feature and thus disabled. |
| `PermitRootLogin no` | Root login is denied. |
| `AllowUsers ec2-user` | The default linux system user account enabled only. |
| `LogLevel VERBOSE` | Comprehensive logging enabled. |

- The following settings combined, explicitly deny all forms of authentication except for Public Key:

| keyword-argument | Description |
| :---- | :--- |
| `AuthenticationMethods publickey` | Authentication method required for access granted. |
| `PubkeyAuthentication yes` | Public key authentication allowed |

- Together the following settings bring about an auto-disconnect feature for idle or inactive ssh sessions:

| keyword-argument | Description |
| :---- | :--- |
| `ClientAliveCountMax 0` | Disable keep-alive pings. |
| `ClientAliveInterval 600` | 10 min. inactive timeout interval. |

- Automatic security updates are routinely applied as discussed in the section on [Package Management](#package-management).
- Pursuant to [RFC8270](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8270) and other endorsed infosec [recommendations](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh), Diffie-Hellman moduli of less than 3072 bits are not recommended. As such short moduli are deactivated. 
- **cfn-ovpn-cli** does not require sftp support, therefore it is disabled.

## System Hardening

The goal of systems hardening is to reduce security risk by eliminating potential attack vectors.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** uses the _Amazon Linux 2_ operating system which is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It provides a secure, stable and highly performant execution environment as it has been specifically optimized for cloud computing. It is associated with a long-term security maintenance policy and is tightly integrated with many Amazon Web Services.

Of particular importance, the Amazon EC2 service utilizes a distributed storgage scheme that has at hand various encryption services that secure data at rest and in transit, as well as encrypting snapshots and instances. As **cfn-ovpn-cli** makes use of encryption wherever possible, these capabilities are leveraged to improve the security posture of the system as a whole.

_Amazon Linux 2_ uses `chrony` as its time synchronization service client. By default, `chrony` configures the _Network Time Protocol_ to use both the **Amazon Time Sync Service**, offered on the link local 169.254.169.123 IP address, as well as public servers accessible via the `pool.ntp.org` project. In the interest of attack surface reduction the public servers are disabled. Firewall routes are delineated accordingly.

Ancillary: As is discussed else where, Security Groups, iptables also offer lines of defense.
Include bash function aliases to authorize my ip.

### Access Management

AWS IAM (_Identity and Access Management_) is an authentication and authorization web service that is tightly integrated into every facet of the AWS Cloud. It allows for the central management of Access Controls to all AWS services and resources. At its crux is what is called a Policy Document that defines permissions. It is associated with either an identity or a resource and stipulates what actions are allowed, or not allowed by that identity or resource.

Of particular note, is a special identity refered to as an IAM Role. It is intended to be assumed by an entity (user, application or service), granting temporary security credentials to perform some limited task. When that entity is an EC2 Instance it is refered to as an Instance Profile.

As illustrated below, templates are used to create three project-specific policy document types that implement the best practice of Least Privilege:

```bash

policies/
â”œâ”€â”€ s3-buckets
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ template-s3-bucket-policy.json
â”œâ”€â”€ ec2-role
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ template-pub-s3-access-policy.json
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ template-priv-ssm-access-policy.json
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ template-priv-s3-access-policy.json
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ template-lt-s3-access-policy.json
â””â”€â”€ cfn-stacks
    â”œâ”€â”€ template-stage3-cfn-stack-policy.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ template-stage2-cfn-stack-policy.json
    â””â”€â”€ template-stage1-cfn-stack-policy.json

```

| Policy Document  | Type | Description
| :----: | :---: | :---
| S3 Bucket | Resource based | Grants access permissions to the calling script identity for a remote storage container and the objects within.
| IAM Role | Identity based | Attached to Instance Profiles to delineate what actions can or can not be perform by the EC2 instance itself. 
| Cloudformation Stack | Special case | A Fail-safe mechanism that defines protected resources from unintentional updates during a stack update procedure.

### AWS Instance Metadata Service

The AWS _Instance Metadata Service_ (IMDS) is a special link-local endpoint available on every EC2 instance where static as well as dynamic information related to the instance itself, as well as its network and its storage can be retrieved by any HTTP client. 

Of crucial importance is the fact that this metadata also yields the security credentials associated with the IAM Instance Profile. For example:

```
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance/
{
  ...
  "AccessKeyId" : "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST",
  "SecretAccessKey" : "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890ABCD",
  "Token" : "...ABCDEFGHIJ...",
  ...
}
```

Notice how transparent the process is. 


The IMDS is available in two versions that are cross compatible:


| Version  | Method | Validation
| :----: | :---: | :---
| IMDSv1 | request/response | Unauthenticated. (default)
| IMDSv2 | session-oriented | Authenticated.


As per above, IMDSv1 is not protected by any authentication or cryptographic methods and as such, is completely open to any user or process running within the system. Four known vulnerabilities exist that could be exploited in an attempt to access the IMDS maliciously. These are as follows:

1. Misconfigured-open website application firewalls.
2. Misconfigured-open reverse proxies.
3. Unpatched server-side request forgery vulnerabilities.
4. Misconfigured-open layer-3 firewalls and network address translations.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** is particularly concerned with number 4 above as the linux kernel packet filter, i.e. iptables is used extensively throughout this application. 

IMDSv2 mitigates for these mentioned shortcomings by requiring, a cleaverly devised, authentication token to be submitted with every service call. A simple HTTP PUT request to IMDSv2 with a TTL hop of 1 will retrieve an ephemeral token.

**cfn-ovpn-cli** disables, by way of its EC2 Auto Scaling Group Launch Template, the use of IMDSv1 and as a added protection, is futher restricted to only root processes accessing the IMDSv2 service through firewall rules. As a consequence and aside note, the functionality of the useful utility [EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html) is rendered invalid here because it operates without elevated privileges. 


### Package Management

Keeping **cfn-ovpn-cli** up-to-date is important because it improves the overall stabiltity of the system by ensuring that critical patches to security holes are applied in a timely manner. It also ensures that bugs are fixed and outdated features are regularly removed, making the nature of the offered service more beneficial.

By default, _Amazon Linux 2_ instances launch with the following repositories enabled:

| Repository | Description |
| :----: | :---: |
| `amzn2-core` | Amazon Linux 2 core repo |
| `amzn2extra-docker` | Amazon Extras repo for docker |

`amzn2extra-docker` is not required and thus disabled.

The Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (`epel`) repository is a non-standard but popular archive managed by the Fedora Project. It is compatible with _Amazon Linux 2_ and contains the various auxillary packages required by **cfn-ovpn-cli**.

Due to packages perhaps being held by more than one repository, `yum-plugin-priorities` is used to enforce ordered protection between conflicting repositories. `epel` is thus set at a lower priority to `amzn2-core`.

The `yum-cron` service is configured to automatically keep the system up-to-date.

## Telemetry

The _Amazon Linux 2_ golden image uses _systemd-journald_ as well as _rsyslog_ for event logging. Important log streams are configured, collated and dispatched to _Amazon CloudWatch Logs_ and the _systemd_ journal is made persistent across reboots. To restrict the volume of local log data, the utility _logrotate_ is configured to compress, rotate and eventually truncate the relevant streams.

### Amazon CloudWatch Logs

Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a web service that provides aggregation and analysis tools for distributed message logging systems. **cfn-ovpn-cli** utilizes _Cloudformation_ to install and configure a _Unified CloudWatch Agent_ that facilitates the collection and retention of operational log events. The Agent is authorized by the IAM _CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy_ managed policy.

### rsyslog

For improved parsing and assisted analysis, **cfn-ovpn-cli** configures custom log-streams for the linux kernel packet filter (`iptables`) as well the for both the VPN daemon protocol activities. These are diverted to a separate log facility for forwarding to _Amazon Cloudwatch Logs_.

## Error Handling

Talk about health-checks etc.
Health checks are done via the load  balancer and unfortunately I had to install a webserver in order to do health checks. Because vpn port ignores unmatch HMACs is it possible to install cert on load balancer so that health can be determined from the actual vpn app itself?
